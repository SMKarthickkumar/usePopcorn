110 - Prop Drilling

    - In React, prop drilling refers to the process of passing data 
        from a parent component down to deeply nested child components 
        through a series of intermediate components. 
        
        This happens when a component needs data that isn't directly provided 
        by its parent, but rather by a component higher up in the hierarchy.
