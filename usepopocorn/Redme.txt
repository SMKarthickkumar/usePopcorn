110 - Prop Drilling

    - In React, prop drilling refers to the process of passing data 
        from a parent component down to deeply nested child components 
        through a series of intermediate components. 
        
        This happens when a component needs data that isn't directly provided 
        by its parent, but rather by a component higher up in the hierarchy.

111 - Component Composition
    - What is a Component Composition in React?
        Component composition in React involves combining smaller, independent 
        components to create complex UIs. Each sub-component can contain further 
        components, enhancing code readability. This process breaks down the UI 
        into manageable pieces, aiding traceability, scalability, 
        and maintenance. Component composition facilitates easier debugging 
        and isolated changes, making web development more efficient 
        and maintainable.

114 - Passing Elements as Props (Alternative to children)
    - Pass Elements as props explicitly, 
      you pass a props as a children it's implicitly
